# Movie Gross
Model to (try to)  Predict Movie Gross



These jupyter notebooks outline my process for assembling and analyzing movie data publicly available from www.BoxofficeMojo.com, http://www.the-numbers.com/, and www.Imdb.com and putting together a model that aims to predict how well a movie will do at the box office based on elementary features such as runtime, widest release, genre and release date. Because this is the first project in which I scraped data from the web, my Scraping.py file is quite messy and I have excluded it from the repo.
